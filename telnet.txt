✅ **Confirmed:** Your Telnet client is in **character mode**, not line mode.

### 🔍 What the Response Means:

The raw bytes:

```
b'\xff\xfc"'
```

Break down as:

* `\xff` = `IAC` (Telnet command marker)
* `\xfc` = `WONT` (client refuses)
* `"`   = `LINEMODE` (option 34)

So:

> 🔴 Your Telnet client replied: **WONT LINEMODE** — meaning **"I do not support line mode."**

---

### 🎯 Summary

* **Mode:** Character mode
* **Effect:** Input is sent to the server **immediately per keypress** (no local line buffering).
* **Telnet client:** Likely the default Windows `telnet.exe` — it **does not support line mode**.

If you'd like to test a client that *does* support line mode (like PuTTY or `telnet` on Linux), let me know and I can walk you through that too.
